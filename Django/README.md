PROJECT - GROUP DATA & ANALYTICS:
    In-memory analytics is an approach to querying data when it resides in a computerâ€™s random access memory (RAM), as opposed to querying data that is stored on physical disks.  This results in vastly shortened query response times, allowing analytic applications to support faster business decisions.

REQUIREMENTS (Prerequisites):
    Python 3.6 and up.
